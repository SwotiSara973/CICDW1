DevOps and How It Improves Software Delivery (from The DevOps Handbook)

Core Principles (The Three Ways):

Flow – Speed up work from development to delivery by using automation and reducing delays.

Feedback – Create quick feedback loops to catch and fix issues early through testing and monitoring.

Continuous Learning – Encourage learning, experiments, and improvements through a blame-free culture.

Benefits of DevOps:

Faster Delivery – Continuous integration and automation help release software quickly.

More Reliable – Frequent testing and monitoring lead to better quality and fewer bugs.

Higher Efficiency – Automating tasks saves time and reduces manual work.

Better Teamwork – Dev and Ops work closely with shared goals.

Stronger Security – Security is built into every stage with testing and audits.
